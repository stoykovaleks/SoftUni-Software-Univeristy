With **"Programming Advanced,"** 
In the "JS Advanced" module, students will delve deeper into the functionality of the JavaScript language, the environment in which it is most commonly used, and the one for which it was created - the browser. JavaScript will be explored as the primary syntax, and students will acquaint themselves with programming concepts through the prism of the language. They will understand what functional programming is and what the differences are compared to object-oriented programming. Students will study in detail the elements of the browser, the DOM tree, how to add, remove, and edit elements within it. They will also examine what unit testing represents and what the basic approaches are to testing code. By the end of the module, students will have the necessary knowledge to create a Single Page Application entirely written in JavaScript, using concepts such as Routing and Templating. They will learn how to use databases as a ready-made service.
